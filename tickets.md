# Tickets

There are several types of tickets for Linux.conf.au 

The relative pricing of tickets is aiming at [Price discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination) to ensure people who can afford it part more but the conference is still accessable for those with less ability to pay.

## What are the tickets

* Contributor - The Contributor ticket is designed for those who wish to attend linux.conf.au as a Professional delegate, as well as supporting the conference by contributing financially. In recognition of this support, Contributors have the option to get their logo and a link to their organisation published on the Contributors page.
* Professional - The Professional ticket is the standard full inclusion conference ticket. This rate applies to most people who have their companies pay the conference fees, or for individuals who can otherwise afford to support the conference at this level.
* Hobbyist - The Hobbyist rate is heavily discounted for open source enthusiasts who are paying out of their own pockets and would otherwise find it difficult to attend.
* Student - This is a concession rate ticket that is reserved for High School, College, TAFE or University Students. linux.conf.au offers this rate as a form of investment in the future of the free and open source software community. As part of the registration process, a valid student ID card or proof of enrolment must be presented to the onsite registration desk. Any Student who cannot provide this will be required to register as a hobbyist by paying the difference in fees between the Student rate and the Hobbyist rate.
* Volunteers - Requires person to help out
* Speakers - Professional plus invite to Speaker's dinner
* Miniconf Organiser - Same as Speaker
* Media - Same as professional
* Sponsors - Sponsors get tickets as part of package.
