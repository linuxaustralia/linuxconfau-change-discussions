# Miniconfs 

## What are Miniconfs? 

## What is the history of Miniconfs? Why are they the way they are currently? 

[Miniconfs started early in the life of
Linux.Conf.Au](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux.conf.au#Miniconfs),
originally with the Debian Miniconfs:

*   [Debian Miniconf at LCA2002](https://www.debian.org/events/2002/0204-linuxconf) (Brisbane)

*   [Debian Miniconf at LCA2003](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0120-linuxconf) (Perth)

*   [Debian Miniconf 3 at LCA2004](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/04/msg02160.html) (Adelaide)

Originally the Miniconfs were *seperately organised* small
one-day conferences that happened to run the day before Linux.Conf.Au
(or later, the two days before Linux.Conf.Au) at the same/nearby venue,
and aimed at "people who were in town to attend Linux.Conf.Au).

Originally Linux.Conf.Au provided nothing to the Miniconfs other than
"here's a room at the conference University you can use", and Miniconfs
were independent and could organise everything else themselves.
