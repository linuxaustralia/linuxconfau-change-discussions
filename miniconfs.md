# Miniconfs 

## What are Miniconfs? 

## What is the history of Miniconfs? Why are they the way they are currently? 

Miniconfs started early in the life of Linux.Conf.Au, around 2003
with the [Debian
Miniconf](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0120-linuxconf) at
LCA2003 (Perth), and the [Debian Miniconf
3](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/04/msg02160.html) at
LCA2004.

Originally the Miniconfs were *seperately organised* small
one-day conferences that happened to run the day before Linux.Conf.Au
(or later, the two days before Linux.Conf.Au) at the same venue,
and aimed at "people who were in town to attend Linux.Conf.Au).
Originally Linux.Conf.Au provided nothing to the Miniconfs other than
"here's a room at the conference University you can use", and Miniconfs
were independent and could organise everything else themselves.
