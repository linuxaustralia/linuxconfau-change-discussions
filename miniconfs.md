# Miniconfs 

## What are Miniconfs? 

### Main Models

Miniconfs can be run in several ways:

* Like a standard conference with Speakers and talk slots
* As an unconference
* A project day (eg Open Hardware) 
* A big tutorial day

## What is the history of Miniconfs? Why are they the way they are currently? 

### Early Miniconfs

[Miniconfs started early in the life of
Linux.Conf.Au](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux.conf.au#Miniconfs),
originally with the Debian Miniconfs:

*   [Debian Miniconf at LCA2002](https://www.debian.org/events/2002/0204-linuxconf) (Brisbane)

*   [Debian Miniconf at LCA2003](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0120-linuxconf) (Perth)

*   [Debian Miniconf 3 at LCA2004](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/04/msg02160.html) (Adelaide)

Over time the Miniconfs grew in popularity, and more were added:

*   [At LCA2002 there was only the Debian Miniconf](https://web.archive.org/web/20020203020052/http://www.linux.conf.au/index.html)

*   [At LCA2003 there were 4 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207105111/http://linux.conf.au/programme.html) (Debian for 2 days, Education for 2 days, IPv6 and Linux for 1 day each)

*   [At LCA2004 there were 7 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20040404053744/http://www.linux.conf.au/miniconf.cgi)

*   [At LCA2005 there were 7 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206030713/http://linux.conf.au/miniconfs.php)

*   [At LCA2006 there were 8 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20060202020629/http://linux.conf.au/miniconfs.php)

*   [At LCA2007 there were 12 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20070208201816/http://lca2007.linux.org.au/Miniconfs)

and from around LCA2008 onwards there were regularly 10-12 Miniconfs at
Linux.Conf.Au and there was a "Miniconf CFP" run at the same time as
the main conference Speaker CFP and a Miniconf selection process to
determine which Miniconfs could be "part of Linux.Conf.Au".  (Around
this time there were also some other independent groups that also met
"the weekend before/after Linux.Conf.Au", organising their own locations
because it was recognised that Linux.Conf.Au really did start on Monday
now.)

### Miniconf scheduling

Originally the Miniconfs were *seperately organised* small
one-day conferences that happened to run the day before Linux.Conf.Au
(or later, the two days before Linux.Conf.Au) at the same/nearby venue,
and aimed at "people who were in town to attend Linux.Conf.Au).  There
was no integration with the main Linux.Conf.Au site, other than a link to
the Miniconf website, and Miniconfs did their own CFPs, published their
own schedules, etc.

Originally Linux.Conf.Au provided nothing to the Miniconfs other than
"here's a room at the conference University you can use", and Miniconfs
were independent and could organise everything else themselves.  They
were something that happened *before* Linux.Conf.Au.

By about LCA2007 Miniconf programmes were integrated into the [Main
Linux.Conf.Au 2007
programme](https://web.archive.org/web/20070202235931/http://lca2007.linux.org.au/Programme#head-7c55d4e2eb375b362533e06eeb559d2c68271869),
and the Miniconfs were recognised as "part of" Linux.Conf.Au, not
something "before" Linux.Conf.Au.

LCA2007 is also when the main Linux.Conf.Au team started scheduling
main Linux.Conf.Au events on "the Miniconf Days" (Monday/Tuesday),
such as the conference opening and main conference keynotes.  This
did not happen on LCA2008 (Melbourne) or LCA2009 (Hobart), but did
start happening regularly fromL LCA2010 (Wellington).  So from LCA2010
(about a decade ago), the Miniconf Monday/Tuesday were firmly *part of*
Linux.Conf.Au rather than *before* Linux.Conf.Au.


### Miniconf funding

Miniconfs have never received any regular funding from the main
Linux.Conf.Au conference budget, although it has usually been
implicitly or explicitly required that Miniconf attendees had a
Linux.Conf.Au conference ticket (with the Miniconfs "included in
the ticket").

For about the last 10-15 years, the *primary* organiser of a
Linux.Conf.Au Miniconf has received the equivalent of a "Linux.Conf.Au
main conference Speaker" ticket, as an acknowledgement of the effort
that goes into organising the Miniconf.  Other Miniconf co-organisers
have been required to buy a regular Linux.Conf.Au ticket (although
in the last couple of years Miniconf co-organisers have received
the equivalent of an "extended early bird" ticket -- ie they can buy
an early bird priced ticket up to much closer to the conference than
other attendees).

In the LCA2004 to LCA2009 sort of time frame, some Miniconfs located
their own sponsors, sometimes fairly significant amounts of sponsorship.
Since about LCA2010 Miniconfs have been explicitly prohibited from
finding/having their own sponsorship / funding, due to concerns about
Miniconf sponsors prominence competing with the prominence of the
main Linux.Conf.Au sponsors.

Some years special "Miniconf Day Only" tickets have been available,
either to the general public (for a notional amount, approx $100)
or just to Miniconf Speakers (typically "by request" at no cost).  Some
early years these were available directly, but since about LCA2010 when
available these have only been available as a special Linux.Conf.Au
ticket type.

Since about LCA2010 Miniconfs have operated with effectively zero budget.

Other than a few speakers on some years with Miniconf Day Only
tickets, speakers at Miniconfs have been expected to buy their own
ticket to Linux.Conf.Au, at their own or their employers cost, in
order to be permitted to speak at the Miniconf.


### Increased Miniconf Integration

Up to about LCA2016 (Geelong) Miniconf CFPs were always run separately,
either from the Miniconf website or via email.

Around the switch to the new Linux.Conf.Au registration/conference
system for LCA2017 (Hobart), Miniconfs were requested to run their
Call for Presentations through the Linux.Conf.Au site, effectively
as a "second speaker CFP" round.  This happened for LCA2018 (Sydney),
LCA2019 (Christchurch) and LCA2020 (Gold Coast).

This change to integrated CFP, integrated program, etc, made the Miniconfs
seem even more "part of the Linux.Conf.Au conference" to external users
such as potential speakers.  At least in LCA2019 and LCA2020 the Miniconf
CFP forms -- on the Linux.Conf.Au provided site -- explicitly asked
potential Miniconf speakers if they needed financial assistance to
attend / speak, just as was asked in the main Linux.Conf.Au CFP.

Unfortunately this increased apparent integration has not been reflected
in actual increased integration of Miniconfs into the Linux.Conf.Au budget.
So other than years that have had a general diversity fund available
(eg, LCA2015 in Auckland, LCA2017 in Hobart) that any attendee could
apply to, there has been no funding available to Miniconf Speakers from
Linux.Conf.Au's budget, and Miniconf Organisers have been explicitly
prohibited from finding their own funding to assist potential speakers.

## Some Alternative Models

* Around KubeCon NA 2019
** [Cloud Native Rejekts](https://cloud-native.rejekts.io/) offers attendees a weekend of ‘unaccepted’ talks leading into KubeCon. It provides a stage for some of the 85% of talks rejected by KubeCon. Runs on Sat 16th & Sun 17th. Seperate Registration, Website and Organisers
** [Day Zero co-locationed events](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/co-located-events/) at Kubecon. Around 30 co-located conferences running on Monday 18. Main conf on Tues 20th - Thurs 21st. Registered as part of Main Conf, Additional Cost.
*** [Companies hosting co-located events must be a sponsor](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/co-located-best-practices/)
