## What are Miniconfs? 

## What is the history of Miniconfs? Why are they the way they are currently? 

### Early Miniconfs

[Miniconfs started early in the life of
Linux.Conf.Au](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux.conf.au#Miniconfs),
originally with the Debian Miniconfs:

*   [Debian Miniconf at LCA2002](https://www.debian.org/events/2002/0204-linuxconf) (Brisbane)

*   [Debian Miniconf at LCA2003](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0120-linuxconf) (Perth)

*   [Debian Miniconf 3 at LCA2004](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/04/msg02160.html) (Adelaide)

Over time the Miniconfs grew in popularity, and more were added:

*   [At LCA2002 there was only the Debian Miniconf](https://web.archive.org/web/20020203020052/http://www.linux.conf.au/index.html)

*   [At LCA2003 there were 4 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207105111/http://linux.conf.au/programme.html) (Debian for 2 days, Education for 2 days, IPv6 and Linux for 1 day each)

*   [At LCA2004 there were 7 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20040404053744/http://www.linux.conf.au/miniconf.cgi)

*   [At LCA2005 there were 7 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206030713/http://linux.conf.au/miniconfs.php)

*   [At LCA2006 there were 8 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20060202020629/http://linux.conf.au/miniconfs.php)

*   [At LCA2007 there were 12 Miniconfs](https://web.archive.org/web/20070208201816/http://lca2007.linux.org.au/Miniconfs)

and from around LCA2008 onwards there were regularly 10-12 Miniconfs at
Linux.Conf.Au and there was a "Miniconf CFP" run at the same time as
the main conference Speaker CFP and a Miniconf selection process to
determine which Miniconfs could be "part of Linux.Conf.Au".  (Around
this time there were also some other independent groups that also met
"the weekend before/after Linux.Conf.Au", organising their own locations
because it was recognised that Linux.Conf.Au really did start on Monday
now.)

### Miniconf scheduling

Originally the Miniconfs were *seperately organised* small
one-day conferences that happened to run the day before Linux.Conf.Au
(or later, the two days before Linux.Conf.Au) at the same/nearby venue,
and aimed at "people who were in town to attend Linux.Conf.Au).

Originally Linux.Conf.Au provided nothing to the Miniconfs other than
"here's a room at the conference University you can use", and Miniconfs
were independent and could organise everything else themselves.  They
were something that happened *before* Linux.Conf.Au.

By about LCA2007 Miniconf programmes were integrated into the [Main
Linux.Conf.Au 2007
programme](https://web.archive.org/web/20070202235931/http://lca2007.linux.org.au/Programme#head-7c55d4e2eb375b362533e06eeb559d2c68271869),
and the Miniconfs were recognised as "part of" Linux.Conf.Au, not
something "before" Linux.Conf.Au.  This is also when the main
Linux.Conf.Au team started scheduling main Linux.Conf.Au events
on "the Miniconf Days" (Monday/Tuesday), such as the conference opening
and main conference keynotes.
