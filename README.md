# linux.conf.au change discussions 

This is a repo for discussing possible changes to linux.conf.au. It is intended that this will serve as a place to gather thoughts, debate pros and cons of options and help to reach consensus on areas in which linux.conf.au could change.

To be explicit, this is only a forum that future linux.conf.au teams, and Linux Australia council's, may use as *input* into their planning and decision making. Nothing in this repository is documentation on how things *have* to run.

## Intent 

The intent of this repository is to provide a public, open, accessible mechanism for elicitation of views, debate and consensus building to occur. 

## Vigorous yet respectful debate 

The issues canvassed here are likely to be sensitive, and possibly inflammatory. linux.conf.au has a 20-year history, and many previous organisers will have run things in eminently sensible ways given the constraints and nature of individual events. This is not intended to be a retrospective of why things were done in the past; it is an opportunity to reshape things for the benefit of the Australian / NZ free and open source community, the linux.conf.au event, and Linux Australia.

_Please keep this in mind when phrasing wording, making recommendations and so on._

## Structure of this repository 

There is one key file for each area, eg: 

* Miniconfs 
* Schwag

Each file takes the format: 

* _Key issues_: An outline of the key issues, the parties impacted by them and how they are impacted. 
* _Possible options_: Possible options to address the key issues, including benefits, drawbacks, interdependencies and any imagined consequences for the option.  
* _Recommendations_: This section is an attempt to reach consensus on issues and options, and is likely the key part of the document that will be considered by Linux Australia Council / the LCA Subcommittee in terms of enacting change.
